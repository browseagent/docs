# Browseagent Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for **Browseagent**, a browser automation tool that brings web browsing capabilities directly to AI applications through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables AI assistants like Claude, VSCode to control web browsers, interact with websites, and automate web-based tasks.


### What is BrowseAgent MCP?

BrowseAgent MCP Server acts as a bridge between AI applications and web browsers, allowing AI assistants to:

- Navigate to websites and interact with web pages
- Click buttons, fill forms, and perform user actions
- Take screenshots and analyze web content
- Extract information from websites
- Automate repetitive web tasks

The system works through two main components:
- **MCP Server**: Communicates with AI applications using the Model Context Protocol
- **Chrome Extension**: Executes browser actions and communicates with the server


## How It Works

1. **AI Application** (like Claude) sends commands through MCP protocol
2. **BrowseAgent Server** receives and processes these commands
3. **Chrome Extension** executes browser actions
4. **Results** are sent back to the AI application

```
AI App → MCP Protocol → BrowseAgent Server → Chrome Extension → Browser
                                     ↓
                              Screenshots & Data ← Browser Actions
```

### Key Features

- **Full Browser Control**: Navigate, click, type, and interact with any website as if you were using the browser yourself.
- **Visual Analysis**: Capture screenshots and analyze web pages visually to understand content and layout.
- **Smart Element Detection**: AI-powered element identification helps reliably interact with web page elements.
- **Real-time Automation**: Dynamic connection with Chrome extension enables immediate browser control.
