## What is Browseagent?

Browseagent acts as a bridge between AI applications and web browsers, allowing AI assistants to:

- Navigate to websites and interact with web pages
- Click buttons, fill forms, and perform user actions
- Take screenshots and analyze web content
- Extract information from websites
- Automate repetitive web tasks


<Accordion icon="unplug" title="How It Works">

  1. **AI Application** (like Claude) sends commands through MCP protocol
  2. **BrowseAgent Server** receives and processes these commands
  3. **Chrome Extension** executes browser actions
  4. **Results** are sent back to the AI application
